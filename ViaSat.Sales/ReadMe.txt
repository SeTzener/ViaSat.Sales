Usually to start an Angular application you should run 
an - ng serve - command but .Net let's you build and 
serve the application by simply press F5.

Once you're in the home page, you will randomly see 
one of the 3 sales recipt. 
By pressing the - New Receipt - button you will reload 
the page and get a new random receipt.

You can also navigate throught the nav-menu to change 
the - home - receipt.

The - counter - and the - Fetch Data - page are there 
just as a sample but there's nothing in common with
the Sales project.
